## Description
This application is a workout/fitness tracker that allows the user to create, track, and view daily workouts. The user is given the option to log multiple workouts a day, and the app tracks the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration if it is a resistance exercise, and tracks the distance travelled if it is cardio. All of this information is populated in different charts for easy readability and as a way for users to look at all their workouts as a whole.
